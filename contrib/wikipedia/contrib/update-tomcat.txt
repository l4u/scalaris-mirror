1) download & extract the new tomcat
2) remove <tomcat-dir>/webapps/*
3) move to new tomcat-dir:
<old-tomcat-dir>/webapps/ROOT
<old-tomcat-dir>/webapps/scalaris-wiki
<old-tomcat-dir>/.gitignore
<old-tomcat-dir>/logs/.gitignore
<old-tomcat-dir>/work/.gitignore
4a) in <tomcat-dir>/conf/server.xml search for the active "Connector" tag and add the following to its properties:
URIEncoding="UTF-8"
-> sets default parameter encoding to UTF-8 (required by the wiki app)
maxHttpHeaderSize="131072"
-> support redirect URLs with a lot of logged involved and failed keys
4b) in <tomcat-dir>/conf/web.xml, un-comment the "setCharacterEncodingFilter" and "failedRequestFilter" filters as well as their filter-mappings, i.e. search for the following strings:
<filter-name>setCharacterEncodingFilter</filter-name>
<filter-name>failedRequestFilter</filter-name>
5) change paths in <wiki-dir>/build.xml
6) remove <old-tomcat-dir>
7) update links in <scalaris-dir>/java-api/test-lib:
cd java-api/test-lib
ln -s ../../contrib/wikipedia/contrib/apache-tomcat-*/bin/*.jar ./
ln -s ../../contrib/wikipedia/contrib/apache-tomcat-*/lib/*.jar ./
