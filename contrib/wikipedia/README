== QUICKSTART ==

1) run 'ant download' to get a wikipedia dump of the simple wiktionary (or download a dump yourself)
2) start at least one Scalaris node, e.g. by running '../../bin/scalarisctl -f -s -d start' (for a deamonized first node)
3) import the dump using either of the two following options:
3a) run 'ant import-xml' and follow the instructions to import data into Scalaris
3b) run 'ant prepare' to create a prepared dump file for faster dump loads and then use 'ant import-db' with the created DB to import data into Scalaris
4) run 'ant run' and follow the instructions to get a webserver up and running

== Creating a scalaris-wiki.war with pre-defined config ==

1) place your desired scalaris.properties in simplewiki/WEB-INF/
2) run 'ant dist'

Note: Properties inside simplewiki/WEB-INF/scalaris.properties overwrite config parameters provided during 'ant run'!
